# WAP
This repository contains the source code for WAP introduced in the following papers:<br>

* **VGG**: [Watch, attend and parse: An end-to-end neural network based approach to handwritten mathematical expression recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320317302376)<br>
* **DenseNet**: [Multi-Scale Attention with Dense Encoder for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03530)<br>

Here, **VGG** contains the code that employs VGG architecture as the watcher, **DenseNet** contains the code that employs DenseNet as the watcher.<br>

## Requirements
* Install [cuda-8.0 cudnn-v7](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
* Install [Theano.0.10.0](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) with [libgpuarray](https://github.com/Theano/libgpuarray)
